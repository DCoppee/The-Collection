          <h3>Collection of some artists I'v seen in festivals</h3>
          <p>Okay, I'm probably a bit of a nerd, hyper literary, and I love talking about the latest novels I've gotten into... 
            But I'm also passionate about music, especially rock! 
            Before spending most of my time with my kids, I went to a lot of festivals. 
            Here is a short (very) eclectic selection of concerts that have marked me.</p>
